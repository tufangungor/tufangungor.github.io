<div style="margin:0 auto;max-width:900px;width:100%;text-align:center;">
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of 2018, I resigned from my job(paramedic) and started studying computer programming at a university in Turkey. I was always keen on programming, and after I started college I devoted myself to programming and cyber security.<br><br><br>
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now i am member of <a href="https://www.hummingbirdscyberteam.com" target="_blank">Hummingbirds Cyber Team</a> and  I am working as a cyber security researcher at one of the cyber security companies in Turkey. I also do back-end development (python, django), front-end development (js, jquery,html,css) and pentest.<br><br><br> 
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to learn everything about cyber security in general but I especially like to study web security, cryptography and low level languages. So in my spare time, I try to solve ctf questions and hack vulnerable machines.
